Task-2: Image Segmentation Using Deep Learning
1. Introduction

Image segmentation aims to assign a semantic label to each pixel in an image. In this task, a deep learning–based segmentation model was developed to accurately identify regions of interest in highly imbalanced images, where foreground pixels constitute less than 1% of the total image area.

2. Dataset Description

The dataset consists of RGB images and corresponding binary annotation masks. Each mask highlights the target region, while the remaining pixels represent the background. An 80:20 split was applied to create training and testing subsets, ensuring that test images were completely unseen during training.

3. Methodology

A U-Net architecture was employed due to its effectiveness in pixel-level segmentation tasks. The model uses an encoder–decoder structure with skip connections to preserve spatial information.

To address severe class imbalance, He (Kaiming) initialization was applied to all convolutional layers to ensure stable gradient flow during early training.

4. Loss Function and Training Strategy

A two-stage training strategy was adopted:

Stage 1: Weighted Binary Cross-Entropy (BCE) loss to stabilize initial learning

Stage 2: Combined loss consisting of weighted BCE and Dice loss to improve overlap accuracy

Gradient clipping was used to prevent unstable updates.

5. Evaluation Metrics

Due to class imbalance, pixel accuracy was not used as a primary metric. Instead, the following metrics were employed:

Dice Coefficient

Intersection over Union (IoU)

6. Results and Discussion

The staged training strategy successfully prevented the model from collapsing to trivial background predictions. Dice and IoU scores improved consistently across epochs, demonstrating effective learning of minority foreground regions.

7. Conclusion

This work demonstrates that segmentation under extreme class imbalance requires specialized loss functions and training strategies. The proposed approach achieved stable and meaningful segmentation results and is suitable for real-world applications involving sparse target regions.
